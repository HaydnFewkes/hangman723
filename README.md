# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Milestone_2: chooses a random word from a given list
Milestone_3: Takes a userinput and checks the sinlge letter against a word
Milestone_4: Added the class with the functions: check_guess, ask_for_input. Creates most of the backbone of the game.
Milestone_5: Added the function play_game, which takes the user through the game untill they win or lose.
